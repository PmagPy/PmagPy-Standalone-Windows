QuickMagIC & MakeMagIC are standalone graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data from the MagIC database.  This download is for Windows only — click [here](https://github.com/moonshoes87/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest) for the OSX download.

For complete documentation on using the GUIs, see the [PmagPy Cookbook](http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/).

To download full PmagPy functionality, see the [PmagPy repository](https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy#what-is-it).

In order to install this software, you’ll need to download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29).  This provides some backend dependencies that let our software run.

Next, get started by downloading the zip file (see links below) and putting the resulting folder on your desktop. You'll need to "extract all" files.  Inside the PmagPy-Standalone folder you will find icons for QuickMagIC and MakeMagIC. (Hint: sort by "type" to bring both applications to the top of the list.)  Double click the program you wish to run and you're ready to go!

Note: this is a pre-release.  There are still bugs to be found!  We will be making a lot of improvements in the next few weeks, including streamlining and simplifying the installation process, but please feel free to send any bug reports to ljonestrask@ucsd.edu.
