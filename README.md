QuickMagIC & MakeMagIC are standalone graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide tools for uploading, downloading, and analyzing data from the MagIC database.  This download is for Windows — click [here](https://github.com/moonshoes87/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/latest) for the OSX download.

For complete documentation on using the GUIs, see the [PmagPy Cookbook](http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/).

To download full PmagPy functionality, see the [PmagPy repository](https://github.com/ltauxe/PmagPy#what-is-it).

In order to install this software, you’ll need to download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29).  This provides some backend dependencies that let our software run.

Next, get started by downloading the zip file (see links below) and putting the resulting folder on your desktop. Inside the PmagPy-Standalone folder you will find icons for QuickMagIC and MakeMagIC. Double click the program you wish to run and you're ready to go!
